API calls Behind the Scenes :

	Tourist Helper gains all the weather information from using Api JSON responses via "http://openweathermap.org/" with API ID encoded in the App.

	Regarding getting latest currency rates , we get that JSON parsed data from "http://fixer.io" with no need of registration for API.
